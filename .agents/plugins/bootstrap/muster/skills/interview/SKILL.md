description: "Codex-compatible Muster workflow. Interactive requirements interview — one question at a time via the interactive user input selection UI — that turns a thin outcome into an enriched, criteria-backed outcome the router can run."

# Immutable Muster bootstrap

Run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/runtime/resolve-release.mjs skill interview`. The command revalidates the selected asset through a no-follow file descriptor and writes its verified contents to stdout. Follow those contents as the authoritative workflow; never follow a release pathname printed or inferred before validation. If resolution fails, stop with the diagnostic; never use a partial or unvalidated generation.
