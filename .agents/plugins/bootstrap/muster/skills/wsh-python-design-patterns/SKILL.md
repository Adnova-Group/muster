description: "Codex-compatible Muster workflow. Python design patterns including KISS, Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility, and composition over inheritance. Use this skill when designing a new service or component from scratch and choosing how to layer responsibilities, when refactoring a God class or monolithic function that has grown too large, when deciding whether to add a new abstraction or live with duplication, when evaluating a pull request for structural issues like tight coupling or leaking internal types, when choosing between inheritance and composition for a new class hierarchy, or when a codebase is becoming hard to test because of entangled I/O and business logic."

# Immutable Muster bootstrap

Run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/runtime/resolve-release.mjs skill wsh-python-design-patterns`. The command revalidates the selected asset through a no-follow file descriptor and writes its verified contents to stdout. Follow those contents as the authoritative workflow; never follow a release pathname printed or inferred before validation. If resolution fails, stop with the diagnostic; never use a partial or unvalidated generation.
