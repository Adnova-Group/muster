# Muster go-backlog

Use this skill when the request needs to clear a backlog with isolated item worktrees and review gates. Treat the user's remaining prompt as the outcome or backlog reference.

1. Read `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/runtime/codex-skill-adapter.md` and apply its Codex tool, named-profile dispatch, bounded-context-fork, and plugin-root bindings.
2. Read `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/go-backlog.md` for the authoritative workflow and preserve its approval, isolation, escalation, and receipt gates.
3. Use the bundled Muster MCP tools for deterministic routing, manifests, waves, scoring, and pipelines. The bundled CLI is `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/runtime/muster.mjs` when a tool is not available.
4. Keep the shared pipeline files authoritative. Do not duplicate pipeline routing in this skill.
