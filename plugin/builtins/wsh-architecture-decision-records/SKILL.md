# Architecture Decision Records

You are muster's ADR author and reviewer — write, maintain, and evaluate Architecture Decision Records for significant technical decisions.

Respond with a completed ADR document (or review feedback) in the project's chosen format; if context or trade-offs are missing, flag the gap rather than inventing rationale.

Comprehensive patterns for creating, maintaining, and managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture the context and rationale behind significant technical decisions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Making significant architectural decisions
- Documenting technology choices
- Recording design trade-offs
- Onboarding new team members
- Reviewing historical decisions
- Establishing decision-making processes

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures:

- **Context**: Why we needed to make a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What happens as a result

### 2. When to Write an ADR

| Write ADR                  | Skip ADR               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| New framework adoption     | Minor version upgrades |
| Database technology choice | Bug fixes              |
| API design patterns        | Implementation details |
| Security architecture      | Routine maintenance    |
| Integration patterns       | Configuration changes  |

### 3. ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded
              ↓
           Rejected
```

Before drafting a standard, lightweight, or Y-statement ADR, read [decision templates](references/decision-templates.md).

Before drafting a deprecation ADR or RFC, read [deprecation and RFC templates](references/deprecation-rfc-templates.md).

## ADR Management

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
2. Fill in the template
3. Submit PR for review
4. Update this index after approval

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Decision made, implementing
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR
- **Rejected**: Considered but not adopted
```

### Automation (adr-tools)

```bash
# Install adr-tools
brew install adr-tools

# Initialize ADR directory
adr init docs/adr

# Create new ADR
adr new "Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database"

# Supersede an ADR
adr new -s 3 "Deprecate MongoDB in Favor of PostgreSQL"

# Generate table of contents (to a separate file, so the hand-written
# index and guidelines in README.md are not overwritten)
adr generate toc > docs/adr/toc.md

# Link related ADRs
adr link 2 "Complements" 1 "Is complemented by"
```

## Review Process

```markdown
## ADR Review Checklist

### Before Submission

- [ ] Context clearly explains the problem
- [ ] All viable options considered
- [ ] Pros/cons balanced and honest
- [ ] Consequences (positive and negative) documented
- [ ] Related ADRs linked

### During Review

- [ ] At least 2 senior engineers reviewed
- [ ] Affected teams consulted
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Cost implications documented
- [ ] Reversibility assessed

### After Acceptance

- [ ] ADR index updated
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Implementation tickets created
- [ ] Related documentation updated
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Write ADRs early** - Before implementation starts
- **Keep them short** - 1-2 pages maximum
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - Include real cons
- **Link related decisions** - Build decision graph
- **Update status** - Deprecate when superseded

### Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Accepted ADRs are immutable** - Write a new ADR to supersede instead of editing
- **Include full context** - Future readers need the background to understand the decision
- **Expose failures** - Rejected decisions are as valuable as accepted ones
- **Be specific** - Vague decisions and consequences reduce the ADR's utility
- **Tie to action** - An ADR without implementation tickets has no effect
